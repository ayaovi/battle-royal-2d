# battle-royal-2d
A 2D battle royal game.

## The Plan

* different speed in water sand and gass
* different obstacles (bullet go through some and not others)
* a shrinking map
* West East North South direction
* but the gun tracks the mouse
* different caliber tanks
* how many players allowed? (5-10)
* tanks special abilities (e.g. put barriers)
* you can only die when you take shots from certain angles etc...
* you can pick up a homing missile n the floor
* bullets can bounce off obstacles
* how do we define lifespan
* press control to move faster, but then you get tired and become less accurate 
* distance from target impacts shot accuracy
* sounds?
